# css-resets
Reset all reasonable css properties

This is designed to be extended or un-extended to cater for any specific use. I have tried to keep it un-biased, but I have purposefully kept some properties (appearance on some inputs, for example) in tact as these are tasteful in my opinion.

Extends from Eric Meyer's omni-present resets: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/   
I have always used this file and extended each time. I've finally decided to upload my own extension.
